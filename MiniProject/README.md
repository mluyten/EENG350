# Mini Project Folder

**4.3:** Motor_Spin.ino

**Assignment 2 Code for Reference:** Two_Encoders_Read.ino

**4.6:** Step_Response.ino <-- only an outline right now, most likely doesn't work.

"GitHub should have a readme.md that describes the purpose of the repository and its organization."

"Your code for the miniproject should be in the repository in a folder named Mini Project, with itâ€™s own readme.md, and further file organization that makes it easy to find the different types of code.

It should contain well documented code that implements the full project, in addition to Arduino and Simulink/Matlab code you can use to verify the motor controller is working correctly. That is, you should be able to quickly simulate either an open loop (voltage command) or closed loop (position command with PI controller implemented) step response, perform an experimental step response, and quickly compare the results in Matlab.

Finally, your GitHub should have a project board that contains the tasks that were assigned for the mini-project and identifies who is/are responsible for the task."
