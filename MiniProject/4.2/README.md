# 4.2 TODO Replace with actual docmentation of code

"You will need to account for changes in lighting, so properly setting the white balance and determining the proper range of color values is key. It will be a good idea to include a calibration step - this would turn the camera on and let the automatic white balance settle to a constant, then the settings are saved and the automatic white balance turned off. Take a look at the classes: awb_mode, and awb_gains. Choose a reference image. This could be a grey piece of paper, or one with equal amounts of red, blue and green on it. Take a few pictures at a close distance. Print the auto-white-balance gains for those pictures. They should be hovering around the same values. Choose an average or values that closely match and set the gains using awb_gains. 

You can use your code from Assignment 2 as a starting point for the Aruco detection. You will need to modify it so that the location of the marker in the image is determined."
